# Introduction

This is a basic CRUD application built to learn how to use MongoDB and incorporate it into a PHP application. The functionality of the application includes adding users plus user groups and assigning users to thoose groups via MongoDB references. 

Included is a rudimentary API mongoDB wrapper, a Zend Application MongoDB resource and MongoDB Zend Paginator Adapter. A prerequisite of the application was to have the ability to load and access MongoDB collections just like you normally would using tables on any other RDBMS via regular models created in your applications model namespace. Documentation on how to use the API will be coming soon, for now please refer to the examples provided in the controllers. This is an ongoing project so I'm sure there will refinements and added functionality in the future.
